## you need to download picom-git and some dependences
+ libxcomposite
+ asciidoc
+ libGL
+ you can check the link [TheCW's compton](https://github.com/theniceboy/compton) 
+ maybe you can't download but it's ok


**When you encounter a problem can be searched on archwiki** 

**when you clone the config you need to load** 
> picom --config ~/.config/picom/picom.conf

if you can not config the picom.conf  
just to change /etc/xdg/picom.conf  
such as:    
> cp ~/.config/picom/picom.conf
